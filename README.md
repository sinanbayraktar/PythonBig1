# PythonBig1

This is my First Big Project about Python


There is no such complicated coding but shows an important result of Comparison of the 4 commmon classifiers used in machine learning


There are 3 different branches as;
- 1 : first intuition, repetitive and simple
- 2 : taking whole code into a function to test different n_neighbors parameters in different runs
- 3 : making some functions to reduce the code load and making it more moduler. it also more user friendly and have a chance to change conditions to make observations

Thanks to Udacity !
